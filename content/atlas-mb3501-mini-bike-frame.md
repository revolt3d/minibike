# Minibike Frame
I purchased the Atlas Mini-Bike frame off of ebay as well in September 2022 for $150. I picked it up from a guy in PA. It has everything except working brakes and a throttle assembly.

# Painting Progress
It's October 6 and this where I've gotten with painting. I'm trying to get the painting done before it gets too cold outside and I have to heat my garage to paint.

Once the fork was cleaned up, it didn't look too bad, but the chrome was flaking off and pitted in a bunch of places. That's when I knew I wanted to paint it.
