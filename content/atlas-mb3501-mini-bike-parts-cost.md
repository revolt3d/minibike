## Parts
### Frame, fork, wheels and fenders
I purchased the frame, wheels, fork, fenders were purchased on eBay. It was a local pickup in the Pennsylvania. 

### Engine
I purchased off of eBay as well, but the price included shipping, and it was located at least three hours from my house in Maryland.

### Paint
I'm painting the wheels with the same epoxy appliance spray paint. It really is totally different paint. I needed to buy another can of black rusto professional. The red for the frame is paint I already had from when I painted my BMX bike.

### Seat
As of October 31, there has been no decision on what to do with the seat. I'm tempted to get a new piece of foam and re-cover the original seat pan. I can buy a new minibike seat, but it's unlikley that the holes will line up.

### Controls brake, throttle and kill switch
I purchased brake and throttle controls from OMB Warehouse. I have not decided on what to do with the switch.

### Brakes
The brakes also came from OMB Warehouse.

### Clutch
The clutch is a low-end OMB Warehouse clutch.
