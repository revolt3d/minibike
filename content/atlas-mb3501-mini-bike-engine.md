# Tecumseh H35 Engine
The first thing I bought was an engine. It's a 1978 Tecumseh H35 snowblower motor. The engine runs perfectly. I purchased it off of ebay for $105 shipped. It started on the first pull. I might need the carb rejetted, but I'm going to wait to see how it runs without adjusting the carb.

## Remove Snowblower Reverse Shaft
I don't need to go in reverse on my minibike, so I cut off the extra shaft. I ran the engine and just held a hacksaw blade on that shaft. It came off in about 10 minutes.

## Tecumseh H35 Painted
I used an appliance epoxy to coat the engine.

## Gas Tank
The gas tank is pretty grimy looking but I'm probably going to keep the gas tank for now. I might consider replacing it in the future. I'm hoping I can clean it up some.

I took this photo to remind myself where these spacers go. They go on the top of the engine to stabilize the gas tank bracket.

This is the snowblower throttle mechanism. I bought a minibike one for this engine, but I have to install it.
